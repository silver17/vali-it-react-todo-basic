Task 1

In some fetch methods we had to set Content-Type header.
Move this header name and its value to constant(s);
Note: Duplicating the same thing is never a good practice.

Task 2

Implement SecondPage. Think what it could show and how it could be displayed.

Task 3

Add extra fields to ToDo model (e.g. created and updated timestamps) 
and display them somewhere.

Created - when todo was created
Updated - when todo's status last changed

Can always think of your own fields.
When using dates, display them in a "nice" format.

Task 4

Don't allow to save same todo message when existing one is not completed.
Display an error message.
